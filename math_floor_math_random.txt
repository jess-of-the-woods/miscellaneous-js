// How does this code work?

Math.floor(Math.random() * 5 + 1);

/*
First we use Math.random() to create a random number from 0 up to 1. For example, 0.5
Then we multiply by 5 to make the random number from 0 up to 5. For example, 0.5 * 5 = 2.5    
Next we use Math.floor() to round down to a whole number. For example, Math.floor( 2.5 ) = 2
Finally we add 1 to change the range from between 0 and 4 to between 1 and 5 (up to and including 5)
